Design patterns had originally been categorized into 3 sub-classifications based on kind of problem they solve.

## Creational patterns
Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

## Structural patterns 
Structural patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.

## Behavioral patterns
Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.
